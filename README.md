# About me

Greetings! I'm Jason, a San Francisco Bay Area-based software engineer skilled in React, Python, and JavaScript. After gaining years of experience in finance and operations, I decided to switch gears and pursue a career in software engineering. I enrolled in a 6-month bootcamp to develop my skills in building intuitive and user-friendly web applications. During the program, I completed various full-stack projects, honing my expertise in the field.

With my newfound skills, I have a strong passion for using my abilities to benefit others and create products that positively impact people's lives. My most recent endeavor, Goal-e, is a virtual journaling app that streamlines the process of managing to-do lists and tracking goals. With a user-friendly interface that is both comfortable and intuitive, this project showcases my ability to design and develop applications that enhance people's daily routines.

Currently, I am seeking a junior software engineering role where I can continue to grow and develop my skills, as well as freelance projects or collaboration opportunities with other developers. If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out!
